* package-retry.el

Add retry functionality to Emacs package.el download operations.

** What It Does

Package downloads sometimes fail due to network issues or server problems. This package automatically retries failed downloads (not builds or compilation) with configurable settings.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package package-retry
    :vc ( :url "https://github.com/kn66/package-retry.el.git")
    :config
    (package-retry-mode +1))
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

*** Customizable Variables

| Variable                       | Description                     | Default |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------|
| =package-retry-max-attempts=   | Maximum retry attempts          |       5 |
| =package-retry-delay=          | Delay between retries (seconds) |       3 |
| =package-retry-enable-message= | Show retry messages             |       t |

*** Customize Group

=M-x customize-group RET package-retry RET=

** How It Works

The package adds advice to =package-install-from-archive= to retry failed downloads:

1. Download fails → wait and retry
2. Max attempts reached → show original error
3. Success → continue normally
